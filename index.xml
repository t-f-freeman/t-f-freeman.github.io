      <description>Introduction I’ve run Python code in a Jupyter notebook many times, but I wasn’t aware that it could be run within an Rmarkdown file. Not only is it possible to knit Python code in an Rmarkdown file, but you can actually make R and Python play together. I’m going to show off just a little bit of that here but keep it pretty simple.
 Running python code in an Rmarkdown file Then, to run Python code it’s as simple as making a python code chunk (using {python}) and run your code.</description>

      <description>It seems like someone in my apartment constantly has a car alarm going off, and they have the hardest time getting it turned off. This just happened pretty late at night, and I was afraid my dog was going to start barking at the sudden noise. Thankfully she stayed quiet, but she was definitely annoyed. I feel you girl - if I could make it stop I definitely would.</description>

      <description>R Markdown This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.
You can embed an R code chunk like this:
summary(cars) ## speed dist ## Min. : 4.0 Min. : 2.00 ## 1st Qu.:12.0 1st Qu.: 26.00 ## Median :15.0 Median : 36.00 ## Mean :15.4 Mean : 42.98 ## 3rd Qu.</description>

      <description>Data Wrangling and Data Exploration 0. Introduction Ribosomes, the protein factories of the cell, are composed largely of RNA which is transcribed from ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeat arrays. The nucleolus, the largest nuclear body, forms around these rDNA repeats. Aside from being the site of the initial steps of ribosome biogenesis, the nucleolus is hypothesized to function in organizing the genome in 3D space. One of these organizing structures of DNA is the genomic loci that contact the nucleolus, called nucleolus associated domains (NADs).</description>

      <description>Modeling library(tidyverse) library(lmtest) library(kableExtra) library(plotROC) library(glmnet) library(sandwich) Data import and descriptions The dataset I am working with is an imaging dataset that I generated myself. I imaged nuclei in the model organism C. elegans of two genotypes: rDNA deletion heterozygotes (rDNA\(\Delta\)/+) and homozygotes (rDNA\(\Delta\)/\(\Delta\)). The purpose of the experiment is to determine the effect of deletion of rDNA upon organization of chromatin and the nucleolus to test my overall hypothesis that the rDNA locus contributes to the overall architecture of the genome and the nucleolus.</description>
