### Introduction

I've run Python code in a Jupyter notebook many times, but I wasn't aware that it could be run within an Rmarkdown file. Not only is it possible to knit Python code in an Rmarkdown file, but you can actually make R and Python play together. I'm going to show off just a little bit of that here but keep it pretty simple. 

### Running python code in an Rmarkdown file

Then, to run Python code it's as simple as making a python code chunk (using `{python}`) and run your code. Let's start with the most basic example possible: tell the world hello.

```{python}
p1 = 'Hello'
p2 = 'world!'

print(p1, p2)
```

### Access R objects in a python code chunk

Ok cool, so running Python code works! Now let's make an object in `R` and then access it in a `python` chunk. Let's use the same sort of basic hello world example from above.

First, create an `R` code chunk (using `{R}`) and load the `reticulate` package to allow crosstalk between R and python:

```{r}
library(reticulate)
```

Make an `R` code chunk and create an object for saying hello:

```{r}
R_hello <- 'Howdy'
```

Now, make a `python` code chunk and access the `R_hello` object using `r.`, then print the hello message.

```{python}
python_hello = 'class'

print(r.R_hello, python_hello)
```

### Access python objects in an R code chunk

The `reticulate` package is also required for accessing python objects in an R code chunk. You don't need to rerun this again, but I'm just including it here for clarity in case someone skims down to this point.

```{r}
library(reticulate)
```

Make a `python` code chunk and create an object for saying hello

```{python}
python_hello = 'Hey there'
```

Now, make an `R` code chunk and access the `python_hello` object using `py$`, then print the hello message.

```{r}
R_hello <- 'fellow humans'

cat(c(py$python_hello, R_hello))
```

### Is that it?

The examples I ran through above were pretty basic; I only showed how to print strings (character objects). Of course, you can do way more than this using Python and by making Python and R talk to each other using `reticulate`. This was supposed to be a pretty basic primer just to show that this is possible and works. Let's show something a little more complicated just to show that it's possible to do those kinds of things.

Let's say, for example, that we really like python's random sampling method and greatly prefer to use it instead of R. However, we love R's plotting utilities, especially `ggplot`, and we prefer to use it because a) we prefer the way those plots look, and b) we already know how to use it. What we can do is perform the random sampling using the preferred method in python, and then turn around and plot the distributions in R using `ggplot`. Let's run that example.

Again, we must load the `reticulate` package so that we can make R and python talk to each other.

```{r}
library(reticulate)
```

Take random samples from a normal distribution in python using the `numpy` library:

```{python}
# load python libraries
import numpy as np

# use numpy to take random samples from a normal distribution
x = np.random.normal(0, 1, 500)
y = np.random.normal(0, 1, 500)
```

Plot the distributions of random samples `x` and `y` in R using `ggplot`:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(py$x), bins = 20) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = 'Distribution of x')

ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(py$y), bins = 20) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = 'Distribution of y')
```

Sweet, everything looks just as it should!

Hopefully this serves as a useful (albeit simple) guide for how to pair R and python in an Rmarkdown document to carryout whatever data analysis needs you have.
