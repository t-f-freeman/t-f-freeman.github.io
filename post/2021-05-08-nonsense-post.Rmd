It seems like someone in my apartment constantly has a car alarm going off, and they have the hardest time getting it turned off. This just happened pretty late at night, and I was afraid my dog was going to start barking at the sudden noise. Thankfully she stayed quiet, but she was definitely annoyed. I feel you girl - if I could make it stop I definitely would.
